# Change Log

## [0.2.10] - 2024-11-08

- Added explicit activation events for every exposed view and command so the extension reliably loads before TaskHub UI or palette actions are used.
- Restored `tsc --noEmit` by supplying compatibility declarations for the latest `minimatch` types consumed by `@types/glob`.
- Reworked actions, links, and favorites to understand multi-root workspaces: every `.vscode/*.json` file is monitored per folder, commands prompt for a target folder, and metadata flows through so placeholders such as `${workspaceFolder}` resolve correctly when executing actions.
- Capture-mode tasks now register their spawned processes, allowing `taskhub.stopAction` and `taskhub.terminateAllActions` to cancel pipelines that only streamed output through the output channel.
- Registered the example JSON command as a disposable and refreshed documentation to describe the new behaviour.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release
